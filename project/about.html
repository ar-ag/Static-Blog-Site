                        <strong> I used to be a pack rat.</strong> I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.<br><br>

                            Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.

                            <strong> I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</strong> I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.<br><br>It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.

                        <p class="about-me-main">
                            Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.<br><br>

                            With how much it turned my life around, <strong> felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it,</strong> and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!
